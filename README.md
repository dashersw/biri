# biri

A unique client ID generator for browser applications

## Introduction

`biri` gives you a unique ID for a browser application. The ID is generated per computer, and doesn't change unless the MAC address of the computer changes. For the web applications that have to use client-side ID generation and that struggle with private browser windows and clearing application storage, `biri` offers a unique solution and gives you a static ID per computer.

The primary use of `biri` is applications built for anonymous users where one wants to ensure the uniqueness of a user. Traditionally, backends rely on IP addresses and similar techniques, however this proves challenging for users within the same network.

`biri` distinguishes anonymous users and returns a unique ID for each user.
